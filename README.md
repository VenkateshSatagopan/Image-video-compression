# Image-video-compression
# Implementation of Hybrid video compression algorithm
# The Followinf work has been done as part of Image and video compression laboratory at the Technical University of Munich
Chroma,acdc,halfpel folder contains the implementation of Chroma sub-sampling, AC-DC Seperation, Fractional-pixel algorithms in top of Naive video compression algorithm to improve either PSNR or Bit-rate.
data- Contains Images which is used for training the Video compression model.
Sequences- Contains Image frames obtained from video to test the video compression model.
